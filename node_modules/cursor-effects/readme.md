# 90's Cursor Effects
_"Knowing the codes" used to be all the rage, I want to bring a few back._

A repo of the old effects that inspired creativity and the desire to learn at least a little code around the world. Modernised so they're a little more efficient, and just as annoying (and twice as fun) as they were before. [Have a play here](https://tholman.com/cursor-effects).

The current effects are:
- Emoji Rain
- Elastic Emoji
- Ghost Following
- Following Dot
- Bubbles Particles
- Snowflake Particles
- Fairy Dust

# How to Use

You need to include the following script tag in your webpage (see next section if you want to use this package via npm).

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/cursor-effects@latest/dist/browser.js"></script>
```

Alternatively you can use a `type="module"` script on newer browsers with a import statement

```html
<script type="module">
import cursoreffects from 'https://unpkg.com/cursor-effects@latest/dist/esm.js';

new cursoreffects.ghostCursor();
</script>
```

And then create a new instance of its type in your JavaScript. The script will create the canvas that is used, so nothing else is really needed.

```js
new cursoreffects.ghostCursor();
```

You can also target specific elements, to have the canvas appear inside those, for example:

```js
const targetElement = document.querySelector("#ghost")
new cursoreffects.ghostCursor({element: targetElement});
```

### or you can use NPM

```sh
npm install cursor-effects
```

```js
import { emojiCursor } from 'cursor-effects';

new emojiCursor({ emoji: ["üî•", "üê¨", "ü¶Ü"] });
```

## Specific Customization

A few of these have custom options as well (if you are interested in more options, opening an issue or PR is the way to go).

### rainbowCursor

You can change the colors, size and length in `rainbowCursor`

```js
new cursoreffects.rainbowCursor({length: 3, colors: ['red', 'blue'], size: 4});
```

### springyEmojiCursor

```js

```

### fairyDustCursor

You can change the emoji in `fairyDustCursor`'s colors with the `colors` option (an array of colors)

```js
new cursoreffects.fairyDustCursor({colors: ["#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff"]});
```
